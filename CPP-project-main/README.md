# CPP-project
This is my first repository created for our class at CPP. At worst this will be a test repository and I will delete it later. 

I'm modifying this in notepad because I don't know what else to do.

Whenever using git you need to use powershell
Then find the file destination you want and type in git clone followed by the path provided on github
Example: git clone https://github.com/lwolny/CPP-project.git

That should allow a new clone of the project

type in ls to see the files in the directory. You can choose a new one if you want or make new stuff if needed

once done, type in git status to make sure everything is up to date. 

if so, you can navigate to the clone on you computer and edit via notepad. 
Save the changes in notepad. 

Then type in git add and the name of the file. 

Then type in git commit and make any comments about the changes.
To exit out of the changes you need to hit the escape key on your keyboard and then type in a colon and the word exit

Example
Esc
:exit

That should take you back to powershell. Then type in git status.

If everythign seems fine you then can type in git push and it should go live on github
