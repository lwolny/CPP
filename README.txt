This is my first web development project. 
This program was designed to be used by teachers to figure out their retirement goals. 
Unfortunatley I did not figure out how to make it public via a website yet.
My goal is to figure out how to get it hosted on a server (maybe AWS).
I've started learning nodejs to hopefully get my program up and running online so others can use it.
